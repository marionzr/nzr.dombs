```js
javascript:(function(){const now = new Date(); const days = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday']; const weekNumber = Math.ceil(((now - new Date(now.getFullYear(), 0, 1)) / 86400000 + new Date(now.getFullYear(), 0, 1).getDay() + 1) / 7); const dateTimeString = `Today is: ${days[now.getDay()]}, Week ${weekNumber}\nDate: ${now.toLocaleDateString('en-GB')} Time: ${now.getHours()}:${String(now.getMinutes()).padStart(2, '0')}`; alert(dateTimeString);})();
```
